# Week 2 - A

## Exercise Description

Write Java program on use of inheritance, preventing inheritance using final, abstract classes.

## Java Inheritance (Subclass and Superclass)

In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:
- **subclass** (child) - the class that inherits from another class
- **superclass** (parent) - the class being inherited from

To inherit from a class, use the ``extends`` keyword.

## Java Polymorphism

Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

For example, think of a superclass called ``Animal`` that has a method called ``animalSound()``. Subclasses of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.):
