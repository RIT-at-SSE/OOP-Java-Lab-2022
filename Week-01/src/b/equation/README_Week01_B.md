# Week 1 - B

## Exercise Description

Write a Java program that prints all real solutions to the quadratic equation ax2+bx+c=0. 
Read in a, b, c and use the quadratic formula.

## Example Output 
````
root1 = -0,87+1,30i
root2 = -0,87-1,30i
````
## Java Scanner

The ``Scanner`` class is used to get user input, and it is found in the ``java.util`` package.

If you want to look at it you can do so by holding ``Strg`` and clicking on the class name, a new file opens with the ``Scanner``
 class.

To use the ``Scanner`` class, create an object of the class and use any of the available methods found in the Scanner class documentation. 
In our example, we will use the ``nextLine()`` method, which is used to read Strings:

### Discuss 

What other datatypes than Strings can we read in?

> integers, doubles, boolean, ...

This can be done by using different read methodes, for example: ``nextInt()``, ``nextDouble()``, ``nextBoolean()``, ...

## Quadratic Equation

Now we know how the ``Scanner`` class works, therefore we can use it to read inputs for more complex calculations,
in this case a quadratic equation.

Try to read the program code carefully to understand what happens in this code, then try to finish it.
