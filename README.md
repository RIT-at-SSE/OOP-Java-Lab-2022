## Printing the resources

### How to Print Java Code for Inspection to PDF
 
1. Select the directory that contains all of your source code. If your code is scattered around different directories you will have to either print it in batches or drop all the files you want to print into one temporary folder and select it. 
2. Click File -> Print.
3. In the menu that pops up select All files in directory option. [This help page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/print.html) explains all the options in this menu. Click Print.
4. To save all the code as PDF instead of your physical printer select a virtual PDF printer. Windows 10 has "Microsoft Print to PDF" installed by default. If you don't have one, you can pick one for your OS on [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_virtual_printer_software)
